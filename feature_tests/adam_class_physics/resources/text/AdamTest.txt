INTRODUCTION

Adam Test is a moderately advanced 3D scene that demonstrates
the ease of using the Eden Gaming Engine's more practical features
in actual development of games. In the advanced physics test we introduce
the concepts of gravity and other forces. We demonstrate the Panda physics
engine's basic character and in addition we showcase Eden's rich physics
features.

Features Demonstrated:

    - Creation and Genesis features
    - Basic Adam features
    - Physics Engine (global forces, jetpacks, gravity)
    
Additional Notes:

    - This feature test begins to demonstrate actual game-making
        capabilities and should interest potential and actual
        developers.
    - Miranda's boots have a bit of difficulty making her fly because they
        have a force of only 9Newtons while the gravitational pull exceeds
        that. The reason she doesn't come down immediately you disable the
        boots is momentum.
    - Ralph is a type 2 collider (both from & into object) so he too can't
        pass through walls like Miranda but he can be bumped into by her.
