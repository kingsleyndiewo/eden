INTRODUCTION

Adam Test is a moderately advanced 3D scene that demonstrates
the ease of using the Eden Gaming Engine's more practical features
in actual development of games. With the Adam class, all the features
of the Creation and Genesis Classes are available, with the addition
of a default main actor whose details are provided for in an XML file
as usual, and this file is identified in config.xml.

Two actors are loaded, a geometry model and capturing actor collisions
is demonstrated. An advanced creation feature - getting the state of
the modifier keys (ALT, SHIFT AND CONTROL) is demonstrated.

Features Demonstrated:

    - Creation and Genesis features
    - Video employment
    - Sound effects
    - In-game text rendering
    - Collision Events
    
Additional Notes:

    - This feature test begins to demonstrate actual game-making
        capabilities and should interest potential and actual
        developers.
