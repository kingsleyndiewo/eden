INTRODUCTION

Eve Test is a moderately advanced 3D scene that demonstrates
the ease of using the Eden Gaming Engine's more practical
features in actual development of games.

In the advanced sample we introduce the cornerstone of 3D FPS games -
object attachment (also known as holding). Though this is a Genesis super-class
feature, the level of complexity is suited for a sample of advanced level. We
also introduce the Glass2D class which allows for the creation of heads-up
displays and other floating displays.

Features Demonstrated:

    - Creation, Adam-like and Genesis features
    - Eve standard features
    - Loading inventories (Genesis feature)
    - Holding objects and cycling through an inventory
    - Heads-up displays
    
Additional Notes:

    - Eve is currently the most advanced super-class, being a
        significant code-base for the Simulator super-classes.
