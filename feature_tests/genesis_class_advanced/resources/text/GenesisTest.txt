INTRODUCTION

Genesis Test is a simple 3D scene that demonstrates the ease of
using the Eden Gaming Engine in loading a world. A models is also
loaded to demonstrate the loading of geometry. A single actor is
loaded to explore how the Genesis class extends Creation. The
advanced version of this sample shows how to make an actor that
the camera follows - an FPS type actor and loads a gazebo that Miranda
runs past.
 
Features Demonstrated:

    - Creation features
    - Loading an actor
    - Non-mouse, actor-centred camera manipulation
    
Additional Notes:

    - This feature test introduces the concept of disabled mouse
        camera control. The mouse no longer features in the scene
        as a camera controller. In the Eve feature test we will
        see a bit of what else the mouse can do.
    - Note that we hide the cursor in the scene; we don't need it.
