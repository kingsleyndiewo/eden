INTRODUCTION

Creation Test is a simple 3D scene that demonstrates the ease of
using the Eden Gaming Engine in loading a world. In the advanced
feature test we explore the generation of terrain in place of a
loaded world. In the physics test we explore the ODE engine's
capabilities and implement a fixed camera in the world.

Features Demonstrated:

    - Applying ODE physics to the world.
    - Using a custom Eden XML file - odePhysics.xml
    - Fixed camera scene.
    - All other features of the advanced feature test.
    
NOTE: In the physics test we don't have the default purple cube.
