INTRODUCTION

Creation Test is a simple 3D scene that demonstrates the ease of
using the Eden Gaming Engine in loading a world. A model is also
loaded to demonstrate the loading of geometry. In the advanced
feature test we explore the generation of terrain in place of a
loaded world.

Features Demonstrated:

    - Generating a world from a heightfield
    - All other features of the simple feature test
    
Additional Notes:

    - The middle mouse button (mouse wheel held down) is used
        to orient the model (rotate it in the HPR plane). The
        left mouse button moves it in the screen's X (across)
        and Z (top-bottom) planes. Finally, the right mouse
        button moves it in the screen's Y (into) plane.
    - Use C to clear all text from the screen.
    - Note how moving the model away makes the features less
        defined. Play around with minimumLOD in plane.xml to
        adjust the clearness at the focal point.
