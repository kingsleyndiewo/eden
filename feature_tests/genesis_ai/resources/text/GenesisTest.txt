INTRODUCTION

Genesis Test is a simple 3D scene that demonstrates the ease of
using the Eden Gaming Engine in loading a world. A models is also
loaded to demonstrate the loading of geometry. A single actor is
loaded to explore how the Genesis class extends Creation. The
AI version of this sample shows how to use the libPandaAI functions
in Eden to implement seek, evade, pursue, wander and other navigation
functions.
 
Features Demonstrated:

    - Creation features
    - Loading an actor
    - Non-mouse, actor-centred camera manipulation
    - AI functions
    
Additional Notes:

    - This feature test introduces the concept of disabled mouse
        camera control. The mouse no longer features in the scene
        as a camera controller. In the Eve feature test we will
        see a bit of what else the mouse can do.
    - Note that we hide the cursor in the scene; we don't need it.
