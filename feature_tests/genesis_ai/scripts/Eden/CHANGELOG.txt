ChangeLog (Eden == Panda 1.7.x)

EDEN 0.1.1a

* The terrainLib directory is no longer part of the Eden package.
* loadVideo in Visuals2D now uses the new Panda MovieTexture class.
* The audio-library-name setting in the Config.prc file is now p3openal_audio
* SystemSensor now has an edenRoot variable in the system information giving the path to the Eden folder.
* Subsequently, the DocGen class uses this and works fully as before.
* When source=0 in the terrain XML file it means the heightfield image is in the images/terrain directory of the MVC structure.
* Added the convertFilename function to SystemSensor.
* Modified the defaultAnimationTask in Genesis to use a non-unicode string (straight from the XML parser the strings are always in Unicode). This makes the task conform with Panda 1.6.x
* The cumulative fixes allow the SDK feature tests to run without hitch on the bleeding edge Panda version 1.6.2.

EDEN 0.1.1

* Added the Board and Outdoor sub-packages of the Simulators sub-package.
* Added spinCamera functionality to Creation.
* General development of the Checkerboard super-class.
* The modelLib directory is no longer part of the simulators sub-package.
* Fixed a bug in the parsing of boolean values in ConfigParser.

EDEN 0.1.2a

* Fixed the stopCameraSpin function which had a useless argument.
* Introduced a check to avoid activating spin more than once.
* Fixed the spinCameraTask by writing a new algorithm that takes into account actor-based cameras.
* Completed the GenesisTestSpin feature test.
* Modified Board_8x8 to hide mouse during replays.
* Made 2 new classes - ObjectPicker and ObjectMover - for the Pickers sub-package.
* Added toggleOOBE() to Creation.
* Added a message to the Creation and Board_8x8 defaultStartupTask so that when the task completes we have 'startup-done'
* Fixed a bug in checkerboard_globals in the hardcoded king capture list and one in selectPiece() of the CheckerBoard class where the capture checks were not considering king status.
* Fixed a bug that was allowing kings to capture their own men and also in selectPiece where some king positions were left unchecked for capture.
* Made the default AI for CheckerBoard. Tested for brute force.

EDEN 0.1.2b

* Made the CheckersMarkII class that adds agents to checkerboard.
* Modified all the feature tests to save screenshots in their root directory.
* Added code to SystemSensor to set the prc values to Eden defaults. Eliminated need to manually configure Panda.
* Changed Creation so that DirectStart is imported after SystemSensor has been constructed.

EDEN 0.1.2

* Fixed a bug with SystemSensor and added capacity to accept custom PRC settings. Modified all the world and simulator classes accordingly.
* Added event processing to Board_8x8 and implemented checking for game draws in CheckerBoard.
* Fixed a bug in CheckersMarkII that made the constructor fail.
* Significantly improved efficiency of computeCapture and computeMoves plus the AI agents by code reuse.
* Rewrote the headers for all the files in Eden to reflect the official name of the framework.
* Made a Windows batch file to run all the feature tests.

EDEN 0.1.2 - Release 2

* Fixed a bug in EveClassParticles.
* Fixed the Linux fontLib bug. Now all common paths to the python installation in Linux are automatically added to the search path.
* Added an error handler to Text2D's constructor to catch fontlib loading errors.
* Updated Eden Maze - trivial modifications.

EDEN 0.2.0

* Made modifications to checkerboard so that a draw situation is noted as a loss.
* Changed the plane.xml file to reflect the absence of terrainLib in Eden from 0.1.2
* Modified code comments in the SDK feature tests to reflect current year, copyright and company name.
* Modified code comments in Eden to reflect correct company name 'Funtrench' and not 'FunTrench'.
* Completed a working implementation of ODE physics.
* Completed the Creation Physics feature test.
* Removed the fontLib directory and made provision of fonts up to developers. The fontLib
  directory remains as an empty directory where one can optionally keep fonts. It also remains
  on the Panda path.
* Removed redundant code from SystemSensor and changed the edenRoot to Eden Inside standard.

EDEN 0.2.1

* Created the initAIFramework function in Creation for LibPandaAI
* Created the createAiCharacter function in Genesis for LibPandaAI
