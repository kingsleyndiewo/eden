INTRODUCTION

Creation Test is a simple 3D scene that demonstrates the ease of
using the Eden Gaming Engine in loading a world. A model is also
loaded to demonstrate the loading of geometry.

Features Demonstrated:

    - Loading a world
    - Displaying images
    - The task manager
    - Displaying text from literal strings
    - Displaying text files
    - Using the config.xml file and the MVC system
    - Accessing configuration options via worldData dictionary
    - Showing/Hiding the mouse cursor
    - Screen capture to JPEG files in the a specified directory
    
Additional Notes:

    - The middle mouse button (mouse wheel held down) is used
        to orient the model (rotate it in the HPR plane). The
        left mouse button moves it in the screen's X (across)
        and Z (top-bottom) planes. Finally, the right mouse
        button moves it in the screen's Y (into) plane.
    - Use C to clear all text from the screen.
