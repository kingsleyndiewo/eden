INTRODUCTION

Eve Test is a moderately advanced 3D scene that demonstrates
the ease of using the Eden Gaming Engine's more practical
features in actual development of games.

With the Eve class, all the features of the Creation and Genesis
Classes are available, with the addition of a default main actor
as in Adam. For Eve however, the default actor is variable and
can be changed by mouse selection in the 3D scene.

In the second advanced sample we include a geometrical mipmapped
terrain instead of the usual plane.egg. We also demonstrate the
terrain detection that is built-in in Eden. Watch the HUD display
the current avatar's Z co-ordinate, which is updated as the
terrain rises and falls.

Another interesting Creation feature that we introduce here is the
recording of sequenced-image video (SIV). This feature is pretty
memory-intensive so watch the FPS value you choose.

Features Demonstrated:

    - Creation, Adam-like and Genesis features
    - Eve and advanced Eve features
    - Terrain Generation
    - Changing the LOD focal point from base.camera
    - Terrain detection, which allows an actor to walk over
        uneven terrain with accurate Z-axis updating
    - SIV video recording
