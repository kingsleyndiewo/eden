INTRODUCTION

Eve Test is a moderately advanced 3D scene that demonstrates
the ease of using the Eden Gaming Engine's more practical
features in actual development of games.

With the Eve class, all the features of the Creation and Genesis
Classes are available, with the addition of a default main actor
as in Adam. For Eve however, the default actor is variable and
can be changed by mouse selection in the 3D scene.

In the third advanced sample we include particle system features.
The particle generator is a feature of Creation and is presented
here for better understanding.

Features Demonstrated:

    - Creation, Adam-like and Genesis features
    - Eve and advanced Eve (I and II) features
    - Particle Systems
