INTRODUCTION

Eve Test is a moderately advanced 3D scene that demonstrates
the ease of using the Eden Gaming Engine's more practical features
in actual development of games.

With the Eve class, all the features of the Creation and Genesis
Classes are available, with the addition of a default main actor
as in Adam. For Eve however, the default actor is variable and can
be changed by mouse selection in the 3D scene.

Two actors are loaded, a geometry model and clicking 3D objects is
demonstrated.

Features Demonstrated:

    - Creation, Adam-like and Genesis features
    - More sound effects
    - Collision Events
    - Clicking on 3D objects (via the ActorPicker super-class)
    
Additional Notes:

    - Eve is currently the most advanced super-class, being a
        significant code-base for the Simulator super-classes.
