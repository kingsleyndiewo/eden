INTRODUCTION

Genesis Test is a simple 3D scene that demonstrates the ease of
using the Eden Gaming Engine in loading a world. A model is also
loaded to demonstrate the loading of geometry. A single actor is
loaded to explore how the Genesis class extends Creation.
 
Features Demonstrated:

    - Creation features
    - Loading an actor
    - Panda Lerp Intervals
    
Additional notes:

    - As in the Creation Test feature test, use the three mouse
        buttons to control the model's view. Middle mouse button
        controls heading (H), pitch (P) and roll (R) axes.
    - This is the final feature test that employs mouse-based
        camera control.
    - Use C to clear all text from the screen.
