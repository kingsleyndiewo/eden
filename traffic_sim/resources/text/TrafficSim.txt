INTRODUCTION

The Nairobi Project is a collaborative project between iHub Nairobi, Intellect
Alliance, the Kenyan government and various other stakeholders aimed at solving
the persistent traffic congestion problem on the Nairobi road network.

In this simulation the 3 key algorithmic theorems of game theory are studied
comparatively.

Theorems Demonstrated:

    - Congestion theorem
    - Theorem 2
    - Theorem 3
    
Additional Notes:

    - The simulation is done using the Eden 3D development framework, a 3D
    development framework created by Funtrench Limited, a member of the
    Intellect Alliance.
