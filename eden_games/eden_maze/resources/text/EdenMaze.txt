INTRODUCTION

EdenMaze is a puzzle game that is fun and easy to play. Just move
Miranda out of the maze and you're done. But beware, for several
dangers lurk in the depths of the maze - dangers that will make
it impossible for Miranda to ever come out of the maze....

You have a limited number of flags you can place to help you find your
way. Use them wisely...

Use the direction keys to control Miranda and press D at any time to
show this help document. Press I for game details and ESC to quit the
game.

HINTS

-   You can usually see a dead end before you get into it, so avoid losing
    those 500 credits so easily.
-   You lose 2 credits every second so hurry up!
-   Bumping into walls costs you a credit each time; walk carefully.
-   Use flags sparingly.
